PONG Online, Made with Unity2022 and FishNetworking.

It's far from playable and not developed anymore but it has some cool features:
- Lobby system, players can create their lobby and wait for another one to join to start the game
- When the match starts the server create a new environment (scene) for the specific lobby, the game is playable and objects from one scene cannot be seen from other scenes even if stacked in the same place (there is no point to move the in separate spaces if not for debugging or watching all the matches at once [from the server, and anyway when deployed there is no graphics only command line])
- Game fully Server-Authority with client side prediction for smoother gameplay

FishNetworking is an amazing library and since when I used it a lot of updates came out and I'm sure there will be easier ways to do what I have done in this project. I used it for free but I would have paid just for supporting the project, Mirror on steroids.
